In this week’s workshop, I learned what is overloading operator and how to use an overloading operator in C++. 
Overloading operator is a way we can implement operation between constructors, which could give a new meaning to an existing constructor. We have three types of operation, unary, binary, and ternary. The difference between this operation is we are using a different number of operant in the operation.
We can use “operator + operation sign “as the syntax of the operation function. And there is another type of overloading operator we called it “help operator” which is an extended overloading operation that could return not only the original class reference but also a new type, such as an integer. And help overloading operators must be written outside of class.
I also face lots of problems when I was writing an overloading operator in this workshop. For example, I have to keep adjusting the syntax of the overloading operator that could match the operation in the main function, otherwise, it could not load if there are errors.
