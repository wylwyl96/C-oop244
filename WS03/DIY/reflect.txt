In this workshop3, I learned what does member function and Class means in C++, and how does privacy work in the class. 
The class is a kind of structure in Object-Oriented programming. It is similar to the struct, but the difference is, the class structure could contain member function, but struct doesn’t. The member function is a function that builds in the class, and each class has two types of privacy which are public and private. The public means the variable or function could be accessed anywhere in the namespace scope. And the private means only the class member could access these variable or function. And before we using a class member function, we need to add the resolution operator “::” sign.
In this workshop, I also understand how classes and objects work in Object-Oriented programming in C++. A class in C++ is the building block, and objects are the objects we are going to access. The benefit of Object-Oriented programming is it could help to avoid repetition of programming. 
I also face lots of challenges in this workshop. Because it is my first-time using class in OOP. I am not familiar with the syntax of class, and the method we call it in the main function. It took me a lot of time to check notes and understand how does Object-Oriented Programming works.
