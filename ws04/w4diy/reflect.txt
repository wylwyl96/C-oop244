In workshop4, I learned some new knowledge about what Constructor function is, what is destructor function, and how does it work.
Constructors and destructors are very important to Object-Oriented Programming. In an OOP project, Constructors are special class functions which are used for the initialization of every object. The compiler can call the constructor whenever an object is created. This technic can help the programmer to avoid coding repeatedly. Destructor is also a class function that is used to the deallocated constructor that we created.
And in this week’s workshop, I also learned a new technic called overloading operator. Overloading operator is a special class function too, which is designed for operating between functions, such as calculating. The benefit of using the overloading operator is, we can use it with a constructor. We can add or extract value by function directly instead of initializing another variable.
There are also lots of challenges for me in this week’s workshop. For example, it is quite a bit hard for me to understand the function of constructor and destructor. I must read our note and read the example several times to understand. And Overloading operator is another challenge, I take a lot of time on reading notes of it.
